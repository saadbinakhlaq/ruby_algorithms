counting change
Write a function, counting_change, that takes in an amount and a list of coins. The function should return the number of different ways it is possible to make change for the given amount using the coins.

You may reuse a coin as many times as necessary.

For example,

counting_change(4, [1,2,3]) -> 4

There are four different ways to make an amount of 4:

1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2. 1 + 1 + 2
3. 1 + 3
4. 2 + 2
test_00:
counting_change(4, [1, 2, 3]) # -> 4
test_01:
counting_change(8, [1, 2, 3]) # -> 10
test_02:
counting_change(24, [5, 7, 3]) # -> 5
test_03:
counting_change(13, [2, 6, 12, 10]) # -> 0
test_04:
counting_change(512, [1, 5, 10, 25]) # -> 20119
test_05:
counting_change(1000, [1, 5, 10, 25]) # -> 142511
test_06:
counting_change(240, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) # -> 1525987916
