substituting synonyms
Write a function, substituting_synonyms, that takes in a sentence and a dictionary as arguments. The dictionary contains words as keys whose values are arrays containing synonyms. The function should return an array containing all possible sentences that can be formed by substituting words of the sentence with their synonyms.

You may return the possible sentences in any order, as long as you return all of them.
