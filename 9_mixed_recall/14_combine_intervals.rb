combine intervals
Write a function, combine_intervals, that takes in a list of intervals as an argument. Each interval is a tuple containing a pair of numbers representing a start and end time. Your function should combine overlapping intervals and return a list containing the combined intervals.

For example:

Given two intervals:

(1, 4) and (3, 7)

The intervals overlap and
should be combined into:

(1, 7)
You may return the combined intervals in any order.

You can assume that the input list contains at least one interval and all intervals are valid with start < end.
