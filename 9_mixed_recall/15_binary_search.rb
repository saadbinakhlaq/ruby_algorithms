binary search
Write a function, binary_search, that takes in a sorted list of numbers and a target. The function should return the index where the target can be found within the list. If the target is not found in the list, then return -1.

You may assume that the input array contains unique numbers sorted in increasing order.

Your function must implement the binary search algorithm.

test_00
binary_search([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 6) # -> 6
test_01
binary_search([0, 6, 8, 12, 16, 19, 20, 24, 28], 27) # -> -1
test_02
binary_search([0, 6, 8, 12, 16, 19, 20, 28], 8) # -> 2
test_03
binary_search([0, 6, 8, 12, 16, 19, 20, 24, 28], 28) # -> 8
test_04
binary_search([7, 9], 7) # -> 0
test_05
binary_search([7, 9], 9) # -> 1
test_06
binary_search([7, 9], 12) # -> -1
test_07
binary_search([7], 7) # -> 0
test_08
binary_search([], 7) # -> -1
