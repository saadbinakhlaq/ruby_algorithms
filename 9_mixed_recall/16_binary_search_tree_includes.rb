binary search tree includes
Write a function, binary_search_tree_includes, that takes in the root of a binary search tree containing numbers and a target value. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the target is found within the tree.

A Binary Search Tree is a binary tree where all values within a node's left subtree are smaller than the node's value and all values in a node's right subtree are greater than or equal to the node's value.

Your solution should have a best case runtime of O(log(n)).

a = Node(12)
b = Node(5)
c = Node(18)

e = Node(9)
f = Node(19)

a.left = b
a.right = c
b.left = d
b.right = e
c.right = f
